Hi! My name is Andrew Brown, I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, where I specialize in Modeling/Simulation and Theory. I am currently seeking a CS internship for Summer 2026. In my free time I like running triathlons, caving, and listening to/playing music. I can be reached at andrew.brandstetter.brown@gmail.com, or through LinkedIn DM.
